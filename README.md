# Mapping Skills Prototype (Angular)

One of the challenges teams face is the evidence of who-knows-what and who-can-teach others.
In many teams in the enterprise environment this is done through specialized software following a strict
process, on the other hands small startup teams usually don't even know where and how to start.

After spending several years via trial/error/feedback I've came back to what is the core of the well
established "Toyota talent" method backed by a simplified skill-matrix that fulfills the base goals:
- supports team autonomy and engagement (they are in power)
- supports conversation on what skills are needed and if what we have is enough
- helps in managing risks due to overspecialization or members leaving team
- promotes community learning

## How to start
### Phase 1) Identify skills
The basic principle is that each team defines in a simple table its members and skills. And this is
completely up to the team, this initial session helps to create a common understanding in the team.
